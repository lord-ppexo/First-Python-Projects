# First-Python-Projects
These are some of my first Python projects : quick and amusing little games made mainly to practice the basics, such as flow statements and variables.

The current list of games are :
° a casino style roulette
° a number guesser game
° a rock paper scissors game


Feel free to criticise my coding and tell me if there is anything I could improve on or do better :)
